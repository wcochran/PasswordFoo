//
// This is dumbfoundingly simple wrapper for storing a single password.
// Note that once a password has been stored in the default keychain
// it persists even after the app and its data have been deleted.
// The first time an app is run, you may want to 'forceDeletePassword' to make
// sure there is no hangover password in the keychain (from a previous
// installation).
// Also, setting a password will silently fail if a password is already set, so
// you need to track (in some persistent storage) some indicator that a password
// is already set to avoid this situation.
//
// Note that use should not store plain text passwords at all; e.g., use CC_SHA256
// to hash the plaintext passowrd before storing it.
